                <h1>Overview</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="teksti">
                <p>Mental illness, or mental health disorders, includes a range of conditions affecting how people feel, think, and behave. 
                    Examples are depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The difference between everyday mental health concerns and mental illness 
                    lies in the duration and impact of symptoms on daily life.
                    Most of us experience fluctuations in mental well-being, but when ongoing symptoms lead to persistent stress 
                    and disrupt daily functioning, it qualifies as a mental illness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These conditions can cause personal distress and affect areas like school, work, and relationships.
                    It's crucial to recognize mental health concerns early, as prompt intervention can improve outcomes. 
                    Seeking help becomes important when symptoms persist and impact daily life. 
                    Treatment often involves a combination of medications and psychotherapy. 
                    Medications help manage symptoms, while psychotherapy provides a supportive space to explore and 
                    address underlying issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reducing the stigma around mental health is important, encouraging open conversations 
                    and promoting a holistic approach to well-being that considers both physical and mental health. 
                    Creating awareness about the importance of mental health maintenance, self-care, and seeking help contributes to 
                    building a supportive and understanding community.

                            <span><b>Inherited traits:</b></span> Individuals with a family history of mental illness are more likely to

                            Specific genes may heighten the susceptibility to mental disorders, 
                            with external life circumstances acting as potential triggers.

                            Factors such as exposure to stressors, 
                            inflammatory conditions, toxins, or substances like alcohol and drugs during fetal development 
                            can sometimes be associated with the onset of mental illnesses.

                            Disruptions in the neural networks involving these chemicals can alter the functioning of nerve 
                            receptors and systems, contributing to conditions like depression and other emotional disorders.

                        enhance resilience, and foster self-esteem may contribute to better symptom control. 
                        Consider the following steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span><b>Be attentive to warning signs:</b></span>
                            Collaborate with your doctor or therapist to identify potential triggers 
                            for your symptoms. Develop a plan outlining steps to take if symptoms reappear, 
                            and promptly reach out to your healthcare professional if you observe any changes in symptoms or 
                            overall well-being. Enlist the support of family members or friends in monitoring for warning signs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span><b>Prioritize routine medical care:</b></span>
                            Regular checkups and visits to your primary care provider are crucial, 
                            especially when you are not feeling well. This ensures prompt identification and 
                            treatment of any new health concerns or potential side effects of medication.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span><b>Seek help promptly:</b></span>
                            Mental health conditions may be more challenging to address if intervention is delayed until 
                            symptoms worsen. Opting for long-term maintenance treatment can also play a role in preventing symptom 
                            relapse.
                        <li><span><b>Practice self-care:</b></span>
                            Mental health is intricately linked to neurotransmitters, adequate sleep, a nutritious diet, 
                            and regular physical activity are foundational aspects of self-care. 
                            Strive to maintain a consistent daily routine. If you encounter difficulties with sleep or have
                            questions about diet and exercise, consult with your primary care provider for guidance.
