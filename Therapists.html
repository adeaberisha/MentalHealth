            <p>Why is important to talk with a therapist?</p>

            <ol>
                <br>
                <li>Well, talking to a therapist is like having a personal brain masseuse. 
                Imagine your mind lounging on a comfy mental recliner while a therapist works out all the knots and tangles in your thoughts. 
                It's like a spa day for your brain, where the only weight you're lifting is the burden of your worries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Therapists are the professional listeners you wish you had at family
                     gatherings when Uncle Bob starts sharing his conspiracy theories. They're like the wizards of emotional Hogwarts, 
                    helping you navigate the magical (and sometimes messy) realm of your feelings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's the only place where it's socially acceptable to talk about your
                     dreams without anyone suggesting that you've been watching too much sci-fi.
                      Plus, therapists are like expert detectives, helping you unravel the mystery 
                    of why you do the things you do, all while wearing a metaphorical Sherlock Holmes hat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In essence, talking to a therapist is like having a personal comedy show for your psyche -
                    you provide the material, and they help you find the punchline to life's absurdities.
                     So, why talk to a therapist? Because everyone deserves a little 
                     laughter and a mental massage now and then!

            <p>Get to know Joseph Smith,LMHC</p>
            <p>Joseph Smith,LMHC, earned his Master's Degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling
            from Eastern Kentucky University in 2015 and has worked with patients in a clinical capacity 
            for the past six years. While in graduate school, he was exposed to various clinical and research 
            experiences, where he found his passion in examining the motivational factors of human behavior. 
            Joseph's academic work strengthened his interest to work with individuals in a therapeutic capacity, 
            which ultimately led to advanced experiential training in crisis interventions and the treatment of 
            individuals with severe and persistent mental illness. Before relocating to New York City, he worked 
            with individuals in under-served communities in the Appalachian region.
            </p>
            <p>oseph subscribes to a humanistic, motivational enhancement, and cognitive behavioral framework.
            Understanding the benefit of therapeutic rapport, Joseph fosters an environment of self-acceptance 
            and self-awareness while promoting intrinsic motivation for patients to act as their own catalyst of change. 
            In addition, Joseph has a passion for working with individuals from diverse backgrounds,
            the LGBTQIA+ community, women with reproductive challenges, and victims of domestic violence.

            <p>Get to know Sandra Estimable, LMHC</p>
            <p>Hello! I am a licensed therapist with over 13 years of experience working with couples 
            and individuals. I specialize in a wide variety of topics including anxiety, depression,
            family and marital issues, grief, and more. I take a solution-focused and person-centered approach to
            therapy. I help guide clients to a new level of self-understanding and acceptance, 
            and have helped many clients overcome self-esteem concerns and relationship insecurities.
            </p>
            <p>I speak with a warm, approachable tone and have a nonjudgmental stance. 
            I help clients create specific goals and check in each week to monitor progress.
            Goals help us reach our highest potential and maintain positive interactions within our world. 
            An ideal client for me is
            one who has an open mind and is ready to work on their concerns, not run from them.
            </p>
            <p>In our first session, we'll have a nice chat about your past, present, and the future.
            We'll discuss what makes healthy relationships and effective communication. 
            I genuinely enjoy meeting new people and supporting them to 
            create the change they desire, and I hope you reach out if you think we might be a good fit.
            </p>
